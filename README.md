# Choice Models and Permutation Invariance

This repository contains the official code for the paper  
**"Choice Models and Permutation Invariance: Demand Estimation in Differentiated Products Markets"**  
[SSRN Working Paper #4508227](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4508227)

## Overview

To reproduce the results, you only need to run the Jupyter notebook:

ðŸ““ **`Inference.ipynb`** â€” This notebook provides a tutorial that replicates the main experiment from Section 3.4 of the paper. It covers both the **plug-in** and **debiased** estimation methods.

All necessary functions are defined in the following supporting scripts:

| File / folder | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| `prediction.py` | Contains data-generation routines, the permutation-invariant neural network, training logic, and plug-in evaluation helpers. |
| `debiase.py`    | Implements the debiasing procedure: moment construction, Î±-network training, and final Î¸ inference. |


In addition,
  - `requirements.txt` lists all required Python packages. 
  - `results/` is a directory to store intermediate results from 100 random simulation draws.
